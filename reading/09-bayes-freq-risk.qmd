title: "Bayesian and Frequentist Risk"
---

We study frequentist properties of Bayes estimators of the regression coefficients under the $g$-prior and independent normal prior that leads to ridge regression.  In particular, there are values of the hper-parameters in the prior that lead to Bayes estimators dominating OLS in terms of MSE.
