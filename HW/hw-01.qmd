Scroll down to the "Installers for Supported Platforms" section and find the right installer for your operating system.

You are required to use  the `.qmd` format to type up this report report.  To get started see [technical writing with Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/technical.html).  Feel free to include images of technical derivations if you are short of time to typeset in LaTeX.   The `macros.tex` file should help with shortcuts.


## Getting started with Github Classroom
