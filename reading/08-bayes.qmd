title: "Bayesian Estimation and Shrinkage"
---

We study Bayes estimators of the regression coefficients, and show
how these can be viewed as shrunken versions of the OLS estimator.
We show how a particular shrinkage estimator, the ridge regression
estimator, can reduce variance and estimation error in cases where
the predictors are highly collinear. We show how this estimator and
other biased estimators can be viewed as solutions to penalized least-
squares problems.
