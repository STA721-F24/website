title: "James-Stein Estimation"
---

We discuss properties of the James-Stein shrinkage estimator and its relationship to Empirical Bayes in the case of ridge regression and the $g$-prior in regression with orthonormal predictors.
While the James-Stein and positive-part James-Stein shrinkage estimators dominate the MLE/OLS estimator, they are not admissible.
